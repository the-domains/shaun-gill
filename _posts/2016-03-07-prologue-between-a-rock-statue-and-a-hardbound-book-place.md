# Prologue

# Between a Rock-Statue and a Hardbound-Book Place

Shredded bits of paper fell to the ground as pages were ripped from their bound covers. Gunshots pierced the air of the grand library. The moments of silence were not the same as when the library was calm before the chaos. Marshall's head throbbed from the blasts that pounded at his eardrums. Two gunmen approached from the distance after they ceased fire. The gentle _jingle_ of their spurs rang along the rows of books that still lined the tall shelves.

Marshall found solace as he sat on the marble flooring behind a guardian; it was a statue of an angel with wings that spanned wide in the air above. Its arms were outstretched in front, ushering a shielding embrace. He exhaled deeply as he reached for the holster on his left hip, his fingers dropped near the bottom of the hole, and his stomach likewise felt like it fell into a hole. It was a habit to grab for his revolver when threatened. Although he was thankful for the generous angel taking bullets in his place, he wished that a Colt was in his hand with a full load of ammunition. It was what he knew. It was familiar and common like wearing a wide-brimmed hat to protect from the blistering sun, or to down a beer while around company.

How many were left? He used a visual representation of the gang by opening his left hand fully, and sticking out the middle-finger on his right because his index-finger was missing. One by one, he bent them in until half were tucked away.

He uttered a mild curse beneath his breath. "My apologies," he said as he looked up to the angel who forgivingly smiled down upon him. "This 's all that kid's fault! She's the one who got me in this mess! If she done--"

A blast chipped off another corner of the stone, dust filled the air around him. Marshall realized he was moving around too much and had let his shoulder come into view of the assailants. He quickly wedged himself even more flatly against the statue and floor. A muffled whimpering was heard from behind a rather bulky dark wooden desk nearby.

"It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't! This didn't happen in Nashe's book! It didn't!" the voice said from the desk, repeating the same words of disbelief even more. It was the librarian and he was hysterical.

"'ey!" Marshall said in a brief deep boom. The ranting abruptly stopped. "Got any left?"

There was no response.

"Have you got any left?" he asked more slowly.

"One," the desk timidly replied back with a shaken voice, as the librarian could not be seen.

"One what--"

"I'm not giving you both of them!" it said as it mustered enough power to yell. "I've got to protect myself from you too." Its voice went weak again.

"You ain't gotta worry 'bout me," he said slowly. "It's these other fellas out here who'll hurt ya. If you toss me one o' them single-actions, this whole situation 'll change around quickly." Again, no response. The librarian must have been weighing the options.

"Okay," the desk decided. "I'm gonna take a look to see if we're clear on three, then I'll throw one of them to you." It let out an audible breath. "One...two...three!"

A single shot _whizzed_ by. The librarian's eyes just as quickly peeked above the desk as they returned below, ending in a loud _thud_ that was his body hitting hard. Marshall swore again.
