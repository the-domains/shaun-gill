# Chapter 1

# The Girl (Circa 1890)

Marshall's calves were submerged in the river. Pant-legs rolled up, suspenders dangling loose at his side, and hat removed, he was in his most casual and vulnerable state other than when he was asleep. He tied his brown hair into a mini-ponytail behind his head, curled the tips of his handlebar-mustache in small circles after stretching it out, and then pulled out two socks that were tucked halfway into his pants. He dunked them into the water several times, and began scrubbing together. Somebody had to clean them, it was one of the things he was obsessive about.

The warmth of the sun dodged through the sparse defense of the clouds and laid across the ground. Marshall's extra clothing was pancaked against a boulder that resided up a slope that led to the trail. His coat was at rest beside the boulder and it covered his travel-pack and most of his gun-belt, other than the handle of the revolver. Although the sun was warm upon his skin, cool water rushed against his legs.

A chill ran up his body as a sudden _rustle_ of dirt and leaves was heard from behind. Marshall whipped around and held his stance in anticipation of a wild animal to come trotting toward him. A constant _scraping_ was heard that grew louder. He quickly _sloshed_ his way out of the river toward his belongings.

A girl came out from beyond the trees while dragging a fairly straight tree branch behind her. She stopped as she looked at the man standing at the bottom of the slope who was at eye-level. Marshall disregarded the girl, turned around, and continued his ever-so-important scrubbing.

"What're you doin'?" the young girl asked in a not-interested tone.

"That's a strange question, comin' from a little girl walkin' a stick," Marshall said.

"It's not a stick," she said defiantly, "it's a weapon." She was wearing a plain, cream-colored, ankle-long dress that she held above the ground with her free hand. There were no shoes under her feet.

Marshall chuckled as he briefly turned back to wave one of his sopping socks at her. "You can hardly lift that thing. In order for somethin' to be a useful weapon, you need to be able to defend yourself with it."

"I'd like to see you do better. I think you're just jealous that you didn't find it first," she said as she stretched her neck in a haughty manner. "'sides, nobody washes their clothes in the river any more. _You're_ the strange one." Marshall stopped what he was doing and glared at her. "What's this?" she asked as she approached his coat.

"Do _not_...touch that!" Marshall said in warning as he reached through the air in a failed attempt to grab at her. She became wide-eyed at his outburst and stopped immediately. Marshall felt an explanation would suffice in apology for his yelling. "It's dangerous. I don' want no kid accidentally shootin' herself with my pistol. I couldn' live with that." He thought to change the topic. "What are ya doin' out here? Ain't nothin' 'round these parts."

She hesitated. "We've got a cabin not too far from the river, and a general store that grandpa runs. Daddy said he's seen you out here last Monday. Recognized you because your right hand's missing that finger," she lifted her arm halfheartedly at it. "Said he used to chase you through the field near school when he was about my age...and he used to push your face in the _dirt_," she added menacingly. Marshall swallowed what felt like a stone. He stared over the river at the trees on the other side that were swaying gently. He disagreed with the wind; he wanted to rip them from their roots.

"Monday is washday and I figured you'd be out here again. I was right. Daddy says you're harmless." She paused. Marshall stopped listening after she mentioned _face_ and _dirt_. She then gestured more confidently this time, but now at his pistol. "I bet you couldn't shoot somebody if they were standing five feet in front of--"

"Why don' you run 'n' go tell 'daddy' that you wandered off by yourself to talk to the _strange_ man in the river! Go on! Tell him you're bein' a dumb little girl! Maybe he'll knock some sense into ya!" Her eyes welled up glossy orbs of tears. His temper got the best of him. He was not only upset with her, but with the memories that he had of being beat up. He couldn't remember the kid's name who did it, but he did clearly remember the grit that filled his mouth and lungs, which made him choke on his own breath the rest of the day, and the insignificant specks that sunk behind the lids of his eyes, but caused a great deal of discomfort. His red eyes made it worse as it gave others reason to call him _crybaby_, even though it never caused him to cry. He only became more hateful toward them because of it.

"My daddy wouldn't hurt me," she said defensively.

"Well maybe he should rethink that," he said out of spite from her previous badgering.

The girl stood her ground, but appeared as if all her determination--whatever she was intending to do--was washed down the river. She barely held the tips of her fingers onto the end of the tree branch that was splintered. Her mouth hung open in disbelief as a single tear rolled off her round cheek. She tightened her grip on the tree branch and began dragging it parallel to the river.

Marshall glared at her as she walked away then turned around to walk the opposite direction. To Marshall's disappointment, she was only pacing the trail.

"He did it because of your stories," she said matter-of-factly as she ignored looking at him, "not 'cause you were missing a finger."

Marshall pushed all the air from his lungs. "You gonna tell me about my own life now? Think I don't know? Ain't no island bein' built outta nothin'. All were lies..." he threw both his socks down into the mud, along with the effort he put into cleaning them.

"How long you gonna be?" the girl curtly demanded.

Marshall looked left and right. "What, is there a _line_ behind ya? You said it! Ain't nobody washin' their things in the river anymore!"

The girl leaned in as she stared directly in his eyes. "No! Here!" she drove a finger down toward the ground. "How long are you gonna be _here_! We don't want you around livin' off our land!"

He looked right back at her. "You don't worry 'bout that. I ain't stayin' long. Never stayed long around _people_. They always disappoint," he stated calmly.

"Think I know why..." the girl said. Marshall earnestly waited for her to continue. She suddenly dropped the branch in front of her and shoved it down the slope with her bare foot. "'Cause you're a loon!" she yelled before making a dash for his gun-belt. The branch quickly picked up momentum and bounced through the air several times as it was headed straight for him. He quickly backed up further into the river in order to avoid having his shins smashed by the now viable _weapon_.

The branch quickly stopped after hitting water and splashed it all over him. Marshall hopped over it and ran up the slope to stop the girl. His gun-belt was gone from beneath his coat, and the girl was not in sight. Some dirt was cupped from the ground. Marshall knew exactly where she went. He pursued her footprints that wound past trees. They led him to a clearing where a random brown spotted cow stared back at him as it chewed cud. There were too many cow-prints to see where she had gone from here. His gun-belt was hanging from a tree branch high above, but Marshall could make out that his revolver was not in its holster. He passed the cow, patting it firmly as he did, and found a fresh brown pile of cow manure where only the hammer of the revolver poked out.

He thought to say it out loud, but it spoke for itself.
